description: "Automated preview deployment for backend applications—isolated environments per PR on Digital Ocean"
---

Preview Deployer creates **isolated preview environments** for backend applications when you open GitHub pull requests. Each PR gets its own Docker containers (app + database), path-based routing via nginx, and automatic cleanup when the PR closes or after a configurable TTL—similar to how Vercel or Netlify work for frontend apps.

## What you get

- **Automatic previews**: Open a PR and get a live URL in 2–3 minutes
- **Database isolation**: Each preview has its own PostgreSQL (or MySQL/MongoDB) instance
- **Supported frameworks**: NestJS, Go, and Laravel with built-in templates; Python and Rust via repo-owned `docker-compose.preview.yml`
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform provisions the droplet; Ansible configures Docker, nginx, and the orchestrator
- **CLI**: `preview init`, `preview setup`, `preview status`, `preview destroy`

## Next steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the Quickstart">
    Follow the [Quickstart](/quickstart) to install the CLI, get tokens, and run `preview setup`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add preview-config to your repo">
    Add a `preview-config.yml` (and optional `docker-compose.preview.yml`) to your repository root. See [Configuration](/configuration) and [Examples](/examples).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a PR">
    Create a branch, push, and open a PR. The orchestrator will build and comment with the preview URL.
  </Step>
