---

This guide is the single source of rules and standards for generating and maintaining the documentation. Anyone (humans or AI) contributing to the docs should follow it.

## Overview

- **Site**: Mintlify. Content is MDX; navigation is defined in `docs.json`.
- **Coverage**: All existing docs (quickstart, configuration, architecture, testing, troubleshooting, orchestrator-how-it-works, implementation-plan, agent-handoff-prompt) are represented. New content must be added to the nav in `docs.json`.

## Structure

- **Root-level pages**: quickstart, configuration, architecture, testing, troubleshooting (user-facing).
- **examples/**: index + one page per example repo (NestJS, Laravel, Go, Python, Rust). New example repos get a new page and an entry in the Examples nav.
- **reference/**: Contributor/agent-focused content: orchestrator-how-it-works, implementation-plan, agent-handoff-prompt, and this documentation guide. New reference pages go under `reference/` and are added to the Reference nav in `docs.json`.
- **New guides**: Add at root or under a new group in `docs.json` as appropriate.

## Examples section standards

- **One page per example repo.** Include: repo name and link, framework/stack, **supported** (NestJS, Laravel, Go — built-in templates) vs **custom compose** (Python, Rust — repo-owned `docker-compose.preview.yml`).
- **Key files**: `preview-config.yml`, optional `docker-compose.preview.yml` or `.yaml`. Use code blocks for config snippets; link to repo README for local run and endpoints.
- **Placeholder URLs**: When repos are private or not yet published, use placeholder URLs and document "Replace with your repo URL" until public.

## Reference section

- **Audience**: Contributors and AI agents. Keep tone and audience clear.
- **Content**: Orchestrator internals, implementation plan, agent handoff prompt, and this documentation guide.

## Internal links

- Use Mintlify paths (e.g. `/configuration`, `/examples/nestjs`, `/reference/implementation-plan`). Do not use `.md` or `.mdx` file paths.
- When moving or renaming pages, update internal links and `docs.json` navigation.

## MDX and frontmatter

- Migrate from `.md` to `.mdx` when adding or editing pages.
- **Frontmatter**: Every page must have a YAML frontmatter block with `title` and `description`. Follow the Mintlify and technical writing rules in this repo's `.cursor/rules.md`.
- **Mermaid**: Supported; reuse diagrams from architecture and orchestrator-how-it-works where useful.
- **Optional**: Meta block for SEO/sidebar; use Mintlify components (Card, Steps, Note, Warning, etc.) per the docs repo rules.

## llm.txt

- **Location**: `llm.txt` in the docs repo root (or as specified in the project). It provides a plain-language "map" of the project and doc site for AI tools.
- **When to update**: When adding new sections, new example repos, or restructuring the docs. Keep it in sync so AI context stays accurate. Mention this in contributions so contributors know to update it.

## When to update

- **New doc page**: Create the page, add it to `docs.json` nav, and update `llm.txt` if the site map changes.
- **New example repo**: Add a page under `examples/`, add to Examples nav, update examples index, and update `llm.txt`.
- **New nav group**: Add the group and pages in `docs.json`; update `llm.txt` if the high-level structure changes.

This guide lives in the docs so it can be updated as practices evolve and ensures consistent, discoverable rules for generating documentation.
